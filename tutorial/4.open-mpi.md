데이터 랭글링(data wrangling) 혹은 데이터 먼징(data munging)은 원자료(raw data)를 보다 쉽게 접근하고 분석할 수 있도록 데이터를 정리하고 통합하는 과정이다.
In this example, we are going to download some big data and execute cleansing jobs with slurm and mpi4py which is implementation of MPI.

* check suppoted MPI version
  
To see which MPIs are supported by your SLURM environment, run the command srun --mpi list. 
You can check the default by looking at the environment's slurm.conf file (which is normally located in /etc on each machine). 
The setting is named "MpiDefault".
```
run --mpi list
```

* install mpi4py
  
mpi4py package provides a Python wrapper around MPI implementation, and It provides a Python object serialization mechanism with pickle.
```
pip install -y --user mpi4py 
``` 

* make wrangler.py in /mnt/efs/wrangler directory.
```
if rank is 0:
  download raw data

data pre processing in all slurm nodes.

```

* execute it with srun
```


```
